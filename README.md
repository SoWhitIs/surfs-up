## Overview of Project 

In looking to open a local surf and ice cream shop, _"Surf's Up"_ on the island of Oahu, a weather analysis was conducted to present to prosepective investors.

 _*Tobs = Temperatures Observered_

In looking at temperature trends for June and December, we see that:
*   Average high temperatures reached between **71 to 75 degrees**, respectively, with a standard deviation of approximately **3 to 4 percent** or **3 to 4 degrees**. 

* December temperatures reached a max of **83 degrees**.

* Out of _1517_ temperatures recorded, the "coldest" temperature on record for the month of December is **64 degrees**. 

* Temperatures appear remain rather consistent _all_ year round in the months of December and June.  

## Summary

While the relative warm temperatures would prove the island of Oahu would be an ideal location for _"Surf's Up"_, it was worth looking into the rainfall or precipitation measurements of the former two months: June and December, as well. 

Findings of this review showed precipitation data was quite low, in fact, raining less than **1%** on average. Recorded below:

Though, initially reviewed data from June and December, it would prove to be beneficial to expand sample dataset to check for an outliers or factors that might be a concern in opening _"Surf's Up_".

As seen in the below summaries, temperatures on average reached between **70 to 75 degrees**, with rainfalls of less than *1%*on average.  Results seemingly resemebling that of intial analysis.

Taking another dive into the data, focusing on the spring and fall months of April and October doubled down or confirmed that opening _"Surf's Up"_ will be a success, afroementioned.  Primarily, due to the favorable weather conditions.
